- Updated fontawesome to V6

## v4.1.0

**Note this upgrade is a migration from Ruby v2.7.6 to v3.0.5.** Note that this could have an impact on any customizations you may have made to your fork of this project. Please see https://www.fastruby.io/blog/ruby/upgrades/upgrade-ruby-from-2.7-to-3.0.html for further information on what to check. In particular, please note the changes to the way [Ruby 3 handles keyword arguments](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2019/12/12/separation-of-positional-and-keyword-arguments-in-ruby-3-0/)

**Note that the Webpacker gem has been removed in favor of jsbundling-rails.** This was done in preparation for the future migration to Rails 7. See [issue #3185](https://github.com/DMPRoadmap/roadmap/issues/3185) for more details on this change. If, after migrating to this version, you see 'Sprockets' related errors in your application you will need to rebuild you asset library. To do this run `bin/rails assets:clobber && bin/rails assets:precompile` from the project directory.

All gem and JS dependencies were also updated via `bundle update && yarn upgrade`

### Upgrade to Ruby 3

- Upgrade to Ruby version 3.0.5 [#3225](https://github.com/DMPRoadmap/roadmap/issues/3225)
- Bumped all Github actions to use ruby 3.0
- Removed `.freeze` from Regex and Range constants since those types are already immutable
- Fixed Rubocop complaint about redundancy of `r.nil? ? nil : r.user`, so changed it to `r&.user` in `app/models/plan.rb`
- Fixed Rubocop complaint about redundant `::` in config.log_formatter = `::Logger::Formatter.new` in `config/environments/production.rb`
- Froze `lib/deprecators/*.rb` constants that were Strings
- Updated places that were incorrectly using keyword args. See [this article](https://makandracards.com/makandra/496481-changes-to-positional-and-keyword-args-in-ruby-3-0) for an overview

#### Upgraded TinyMCE to v6

- Upgraded TinyMCE to v6 (v5 EOL is April 20 2023)
- Adjusted JS code to conform to new TinyMCE version
- Adjusted views to work with the new version
- Updated variables.scss file to fix issue with button text/background color contrast
- Updated blocks/_tables.scss to fix issue with dropdown menu overlap against table
- updated config/initializers/assets.rb to copy over the tinymce skins and bootstrap glyphicons to the public directory so that they are accessible by TinyMCE and Bootstrap code

#### Removed webpacker gem

As Webpacker is no longer maintained by the Rails community, we have replaced it by `jsbundling-rails` and `cssbundling-rails` for the Javascript & CSS compilation.

- Removed `webpacker` gem
- Added `jsbundling-rails`
- Updated webpack and its configuration to V5
- Moved `app/javascript/packs/application.js` to `app/javascript/application.js`
- Removed `ruby-sass` gem
- Added `cssbundling-rails` gem and DartSass JS library
- Updated SASS stylesheets following the migration to the latest version of the `sass` package (See below).
- Removed `font-awesome-sass` gem and used `@fortawesome/fontawesome-free` npm package
- Issue with `@import 'font-awesome-sprockets';` line in `app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss`. Removed that line after referring to the latest font-awesome install/setup guide which no longer includes it.

With the removal of Webpacker, the Javascript/SASS code is no longer automaticaly compiled when using the `rails server` command. It has been replaced by the `bin/dev` command that launch the rails server and the processes that watch for changes in the SASS and Javascript code.

#### SASS update : removal of the `@import` keyword

With the removal of the webpacker gem, the DartSass package has been installed to ensure the compilation of the Sass stylesheet and with it, an update to the Sass version used by the code :
- `@import` keyword for custom stylesheets has been removed (although we can still import stylesheets from externals packages) and has been replaced by `@use` and `@forward`
- An `_index.scss` file have to be created in folders containing multiple sass files. Each file have to be included in the index with the `@use` or `@forward` keyword.
- In most cases `@import` can be replaced by `@use` when importing a file.
- `@forward` makes mixins, functions and variables available when a stylesheet is loaded.
- When imported, Sass variables are now namespaced with the file name in which they are declared (ex : `color: colors.$red`). A namespace can be renamed (ex : `@use "colours" as c;`) or removed when included (ex : `@use "colours" as *;`)
- Sass variables are no longer declared globally and have to be included in files where they are used.

### Introduction of RackAttack
[Rack Attack](https://github.com/rack/rack-attack) is middleware that can be used to help protect the application from malicious activity. You can establish white/black lists for specific IP addresses and also define rate limits.

- Using Rack-attack address vulnerabilities pointed out in password reset and login: there was no request rate limit.[#3214](https://github.com/DMPRoadmap/roadmap/issues/3214)

### GitHub actions updates
- Added node version specification (v16) to eslint, PostgreSQL and MySQL github action to eliminate `digital routine enveloped` error [#319](https://github.com/portagenetwork/roadmap/issues/319)

### Enhancements
